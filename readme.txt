Xili-theme select is an automatic selector of theme according defined rules: one for current browsers and anothers for mobile browsers (iPhone, iPad)

== Description ==

*Xili-theme select is an automatic selector of theme according a series of defined rules: one for current browsers and anothers for (each) mobile browsers (iPhone, iPad, and more).*

The plugin xili-theme select don't content itself themes. The available themes remain in Themes folder and are selected between the current browser and the rulers defined by webmaster. Webmaster is totally free to define (the look of) the theme on each side (desktop or other). There is no automatic look transformation. Each available theme can be responsive or not. Plugin is compatible with child themes.

> Prerequisites : themes must be well developped according current WP core rules like well done in bundled themes.

By default, Xili-theme select is provided with a small series of default rules for iPhone, iPad, and mobile based Chrome browsers. With a filter, it will be possible to define your own rules

If the themes are "international", xili-theme select don't interfere and so is full compatible with [xili-language](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-language/ "xili-language").

This version 2.0 includes latest famous free library/class from Anthony Hand : [Github of mobilesp](https://github.com/ahand/mobileesp).

**prerequisite:**

**Caution:** - Before use *xili-theme select*: uninstall plugins like  *'any-mobile-theme-switcher'*, *'Device Theme Switcher'*, *'iwphone'* or *'WordPress PDA & iPhone'* which do theme's redirections as here.

**Note about theme with template_page:**
Both themes (the current and the one for iphone / ipodtouch) must contain the same template (name) - the contents can differ obviously -
A good architecture : multiple child themes with same parent!
