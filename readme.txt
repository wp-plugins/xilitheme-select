Xilitheme select provides an automatic selection of themes : one for current browsers and another for iphone/ipod touch browser (and more).

== Description ==

*Xilitheme select provides an automatic selection of themes : one for current browsers and another for iphone/ipod touch browser (and more non "Apple touch" mobiles).*

The plugin xilitheme-select don't content itself themes. The themes remain in Themes folder and are selected by the current browser and the rulers defined by webmaster. Webmaster is totally free to define (the look of) the theme on each side (desktop or iPhone). There is no automatic look transformation. 

If the themes are "international", xilitheme select don't interfere and so is full compatible with [xili-language](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-language/ "xili-language").

**prerequisite:**
By default:
In addition of your current selected theme add in the themes folder a theme folder named as the current with extension *'_4touch'* dedicaced for iphone browser.

**Caution:** - Before use *xilitheme select*: uninstall plugins like *'iwphone'* or *'WordPress PDA & iPhone'* which do theme's redirections as this.

**Note about theme with template_page:**
Both themes (the current and the one for iphone / ipodtouch) must contain the same template (name) - the contents can differ obviously -

The interface provide ways to change default extension or choose a specific fullname (for the "iphone" theme)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Verify that the folder of this theme has a right name with right extension.

It is an easiness to choose a theme with a folder without the proposed file extension.
